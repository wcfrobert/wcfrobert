My name is Robert. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) in the state of California. My interest lies in the intersection of engineering and design.

People call me Bob, or Rob. I would prefer to be called Bob the builder, or Rob the builder; However, the former is copyrighted, and the latter sounds like an instruction rather than a name.
